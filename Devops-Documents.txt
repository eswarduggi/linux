Server
------------------------------
Host the applications
	
OS
------------------------------
os interacts with hardward and softwares. it has few parts
Kernel-- Heart of OS, interacrt with hardware
Shell- takes the input from user and pass to kernel to do utilities

UNIX OS----------------
Very costly 
tightly coupled with hardware

UNIX+Hardware == not Portable

Linus Torvals
MS-DOS-- IBM
Free
no hardware locking =Portablebased on unix principle ---> using c Language
Kernal+Shell = Linux
96% servers running in Linux in the word

Less Cost
More performance - Consume less memory and more speed

secured - Originally from UNIX principles
More Community support
highly stable --> run for years
Low power 

OPensource Kernel with Shell
----------------------------------
add more utilities -> ubuntu, federe,Centos,
Linux+shell+graphices==Android, ubuntu, Desktop


Authentication and Authentication
--------------------------------
username
password

what you know -->password
What you know --> username key
what you are --> fingerprint, palm, retina

Public Key and private key
----------------------------------
public -- keep inside the servers

Server=box=node
private kay--> whoever wants access they have private keay

IP/Public Key 

How to generate
-----------------------
ssh-keygen - f <file-name> = private key and public key
Git bhash -- mini Linux in windows = you can use Linux commands up to some

ssh-ras <some code> username@computer name = Public key
on -premise
-----------------
your company data center

RHEL---> Licensed , give us some support,
Tehy will give the us code, they welcome everyone to develop


Centos --They will take code of RHEL and building it releasing it as Centos
Centos Comminity support 

Utuntu

Oracle Suse
how to connect server using git bash
-------------------------------------
ssh -- securesheel =Protocals

Protocals
usernamepassword/ private key
port

HTTP- 80
HTTPS -443
SSH -22 = Complete access to server
Ssh - i <Prinate-key> username@IP ( ssh -i Downloads/linuxos.pem ec2-user@server ip)

IT/software -- Exchanging information between computers

$ -- normal user
# --Root user

Switch to Root --> Sudi su -

Yum install nginx -y -- to install software

systemctl start nginx -- to satrt the nginx

access server from browser -- https://ip address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PWD- present working directory
case sensitive
Google and google both different in linux

uname - which operabting systemctl
uname -a it will give full information

<command-name> <option> <input>

uname --all
uname --help
 -s,-p,-n 
 
 man uname - it will give manual information
 man --help
 
 ls--> list of the files
 
 cd / -- change directory
 ls -l --> lenthy format
 ls -lr -- revers lenthy format
 ls -lt
 ls-ltr
 
 ls -la -- it will show hidden files/directories
 ls -lar - it will give revers format
 
 CRUD--- Create,read,update, delete
 
 touch file name.txt --- to crcrate files
 mkdir - create directory
 cat > <file name> it will creat file and allow you to enter the text
 
 ctrl+d -- to save the content
 
 cat <filename> -- to see the content
 
 up-arrow--> you can see the previous commands
 > redicetion,deleted old data and create new
 >> append data in existing file
 
 cd demo/ -- to enter into demo directory
 cd .. one step back to directory
 
 cat <files1> <file2>   > <files2> -- it will merge file1 to file2
 
 cp -- copy 
 cp example.txt demo
 Cp <source> <destination>
 
 Mv - like cut,
 
 mv <source> <destination>
 
 Mkdir <directory name> to create folder/directory
 
 mv demo2 demo
 cd demo/
 mv demo2 ..
 
 cp demo2 demo
 
 cp demo2 demo -r  it will copy all files in that folder
 -r -- recursive in linux
 
 rm - rmeove directory\files
  rm demo
  rm -- command will delete only empty directories
  
  rm -r demo

  cp /etc/passwd passwd
  cp /etc/hosts hosts
  
  cat passwd
  
  grep bin passwd  find the ward bin
  grep shutdown passwd find shutdown word
  
  cat >> passwd
  google
  GOOGLE -- save the file
  cat passwd
  
  grep google passwd
  grep -i google passwd  --- -i is case in sensitive
  Grep <word-to-find> <file name>
  grep 
  head file name -- it will give first 10 lines
  
  
  head passwd
  head <file-name>
  
  head -n 2 passwd
  
  tail passwd
  tail -n 2 passwd
  
  echo hi Linux -- to print some thing in linux, we use echo command
  
  Linux stores the command success/failure in exit status
  echo $?
  0- success
  anything - failure
  
  to see success or failure in linux we use echo $? -- 0 mean success, 1 means failure
  
  wget <url> - to download the file
  w- means web
  
  by default wget not installed in linux like chrome
  sudo yum install wget -y
  
  ls -l
  
  curl <rul>
  to view the source at the run console
  
  cat variable.tf
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ownership and permission
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  mutiple users can login at the same time
  
  Ownership
  ------------
  user -- the one who created
  Group --- which Groupo
  Others -- other than the owner and group
  
  Centos is created, a group with same namealso created by default
  - <file or Directory> rw- user rw- group r-- pthers
  r- read
  w- write
  x - execute
  
  john -- add him to centos group
  ramesh-- don't add him to centos group
  rahesh -- other user
  if he logs ito linux server he gets 
  
  user/owner -- u
  Group-- g
  Others --o 
  
  Chmod
  ---------------
  Change the permission
  
  chmod u+x variable.tf
  user got execution access.
  
  ls -l
  chmod g-w variable.tf
  group don't have write access
  chmod o+x variable.tf -- other have only execution access.
  
  chmod ugo+x variable.tf -- every on hava execution access
  
  chmod ugo-x variable.tf - remove execition permission
  
  R -- 4
  W---2
  X---1
  754
  chmod 745 variable.tf
  
  chmod 400 variables.tf

 How to create user -- you must have a root
 
 CRUD
 -----------------
 useradd>user-name>
 password to the user
  passwd <username>
  
  read the user information
  id <user-name>
  id - it will give you current user info .root user id is 0
  whenever a user is created , by default a group on the same name will be created
  ]Every  user have
  1. primary group
  2. secondary group
  
  to see all the users information
  vim /etc/passwd
   yum install vim -y -- if not install vim
   
   getent /paaswd -- (/etc/passwd)to give entries of password file
   
   GROUP Information
   -----------------------------
   CRUD
   ------
   groupadd <group-name>
   
   getent group
   
   give access to the group and then add users to the group
   usermod -a <Group-Name> user name  -- aads to secondary groups
      usermod -g <Group-Name> user name --
	  Remove user from group -- gpasswd -d  <user-name> <grtoup-name>
	  
	  gpasswd -d kumar developer
	now user have on primary and one secondary group which is developer
now user kumar to be in support group for few days\
 usermod -a -G support kumar	
   
   groupdell <group-name>
   
   gpasswd -d kumar developer
   
   chamod -g kumar kuamr --to add his own group
   
   userdel kumar -- to delete the user
   first remove user from primay and secondary groups
   gpasswd -d <user-name> <user-name>
  the groups and added to his own group
  usermod -g <user-name(default-group)> <username> --> user will be deleted from all the groups

userdel <user-name>

groupdel <group-name>
   
   ssh kumar@ip
   by defult, users will not login with passwrd, for the we need to change the sshd_config
   vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    search for password, and password authentication change to "YES". if still not able to login with user, restart the service systemctl restart sshd
	
	USer joins the organozation
	----------------------------------
	Admin will ask him give his public key.
	su -kumar
	mkdir .ssh
	chmod 700 .ssh -R
	cd .ssh
	touch authorized_keys
	vim authorized_keys
	
	cat kumar.pub  user will share with aadmin
	admin add kumar public key in autorized keys, shift to copy key
	chmod 400 authorized_keys
	.
	admin ask kumar to login
	ssh -i kumar kumar@ip
	
	how you will give root access to kumar
	vim /etc/sudoers
	 or 
	 usermod -aG wheel kumar, will added to wheel group to get root access to kumar
	 passwd kumar
	 sudo yum install wget -y
	 sudo su -
	 gpasswd -d kumar wheel
	 
	 or
	 vim /etc/sudoers
	 
	 kumar ALL=(ALL)  ALL -- add this in the sudoers file to get admin access to kumar
	 
	 
	 Pakage management
	 ------------------------
	 Yum --> Yellow dog utility manager
	 rpm - redhat package management
	 
	 a game --> java should be installed
	 
	 game has a dependency on java
	 1. install java
	 2. install game
	 
	 if you use yum, install game , yum can undestand dependency and inatll
	 
	 yum install nginx -y
	 
	 
	 cd /etc/yum.repos.d/ --- all repo information here
	  yum list installed ---> show all pakages installed
	  
	  yum list installed |wc -l -- count package
	  
	 yum list all -- all pakages
	 
	 yum list all |wc -l -- show all pakages
	 
	 yum update -y ---- it will do update for all pakages
